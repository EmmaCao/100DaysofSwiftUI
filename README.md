# 100 Days of SwiftUI
[100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

I got a new Mac, and upgraded to Catalina. Got to do something excited, YE!

My progress is posted [here](https://twitter.com/EmmaCao2010).


## Rules
1. Every day you spend one hour reading or watching SwiftUI tutorials, or writing SwiftUI code.
2. Every day you post about your progress to the social media site of your choosing. Tell people!

## Tips
1. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.
2. Don’t fall prey to shiny object syndrome.
3. Don’t lone wolf it. You aren’t learning by yourself – I’m here to help as are many others. If you have questions, tweet me at @twostraws and I’ll do my best to help!
